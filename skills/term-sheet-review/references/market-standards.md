## Detailed Standards

### Liquidation Preference

**Market standard (98% of deals in 2025)**: 1x non-participating

| Type | Description | Rating |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1x non-participating | Investor gets 1x investment OR converts to common (greater of) | Founder-friendly / Market |
| 1x participating | Investor gets 1x PLUS pro-rata share of remainder | Investor-friendly |
| 2x+ non-participating | Investor gets 2x+ OR converts | Investor-friendly |
| 2x+ participating | Investor gets 2x+ PLUS share | Highly investor-friendly |

**Data**: 95% of deals are non-participating. Multiple preferences (1.5x+) appear in ~8% of deals, up from 2.3% in 2021 - often in difficult fundraising environments.

### Anti-Dilution

**Market standard**: Broad-based weighted average

| Type | Description | Rating |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Broad-based weighted average | Adjusts based on size/price of down round, includes all shares | Market standard |
| Narrow-based weighted average | Same formula but excludes some shares from calculation | Investor-friendly |
| Full ratchet | Conversion price drops to new round price | Highly investor-friendly |

**Data**: 46% of deals include strong anti-dilution protections. Full ratchet is rare and considered aggressive.

### Board Composition

**Market standard by stage**:

| Stage | Typical Composition | Investor-friendly deviation |
|-------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| Pre-seed | 2 founders, 0 investors | Any investor board seat |
| Seed | 2 founders, 1 investor (or observer) | Investor majority |
| Series A | 2 founders, 1 investor, 1 independent | 2+ investor seats |

**Key principle**: Founders should maintain board control through Series A. Balanced boards (not founder-controlled) become more common at Series B+.

### Protective Provisions

**Standard provisions (acceptable)**:
- Changes to charter/bylaws adversely affecting preferred
- Authorization of senior or pari passu securities
- Increase authorized preferred shares
- Redemption of shares (except employee repurchases)
- Declaration of dividends
- Liquidation, dissolution, or sale of company
- Change number of board directors

**Aggressive provisions (investor-friendly)**:
- Approval of annual budget
- Hiring/firing executives
- Any debt above threshold
- Any equity issuance
- Changes to business line
- Approval of all option grants

**Data**: Protective provisions appear in 90%+ of deals, but scope varies significantly.

### Pro-rata Rights

**Market standard**: Major investors get pro-rata rights in future rounds

| Stage | Typical threshold | Notes |
|-------|-------------------|-------|
| Seed | $100K-$250K investment | May include super pro-rata for lead |
| Series A | $500K-$1M investment | "Major Investor" threshold |

**Founder concern**: Too many pro-rata rights can crowd out new investors in future rounds.

### Dividends

**Market standard**: 6-8% non-cumulative, payable when declared

| Type | Description | Rating |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Non-cumulative, when declared | Only paid if board declares | Market standard |
| Cumulative | Accrues whether or not declared | Investor-friendly |
| Participating | Gets dividend AND participates as common | Investor-friendly |

### Founder Vesting

**Market standard**: 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff

| Situation | Market approach |
|-----------|-----------------|
| New founders | 4 years monthly, 1-year cliff |
| Founders with history | Credit for time served, often 2-3 years remaining |
| Acceleration | Single-trigger rare; double-trigger for 25-100% |

### No-Shop Period

**Market standard**: 30-60 days

| Duration | Rating |
|----------|--------|
| 30 days | Founder-friendly |
| 45 days | Market standard |
| 60+ days | Investor-friendly |
| 90+ days | Aggressive |

### Option Pool

**Market standard**: 10-20% post-money

| Size | Context |
|------|---------|
| 10% | Lean team, limited near-term hiring |
| 15% | Typical seed/Series A |
| 20% | Aggressive hiring plans, exec recruits needed |

**Key issue**: Option pool is typically included in pre-money valuation, effectively reducing founder ownership. Larger pools = more dilution for founders.

### Pay-to-Play

**Market standard**: Rare but increasing (~10% of deals in 2025)

Requires investors to participate in future rounds or lose preferred rights. More common in:
- Difficult fundraising environments
- Bridge rounds
- Down rounds

## Red Flags by Perspective

### For Startups - Watch Out For:
- Participating preferred with >1x liquidation
- Full ratchet anti-dilution
- Investor board majority before Series B
- Extensive protective provisions (budget approval, hiring)
- Cumulative dividends
- Redemption rights
- No-shop >60 days
- Super pro-rata rights for all investors

### For Investors - Watch Out For:
- No protective provisions
- No anti-dilution
- No information rights
- No pro-rata rights
- Founder vesting already complete
- No drag-along rights
- ROFR/co-sale that excludes investor
