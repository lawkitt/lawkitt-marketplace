## Dual Licensing

Some projects use dual licensing strategies:

### Common Patterns

1. **GPL + Commercial**: Project is GPL for open source use, commercial license available for proprietary use
   - Examples: MySQL, Qt, MongoDB (historical)

2. **MIT/Apache + Patent**: Permissive license with separate patent grant
   - Example: React (MIT + Facebook patent grant, later changed to MIT only)

3. **LGPL + Commercial**: Library is LGPL, commercial license for static linking
   - Example: Qt

### How to Indicate Dual Licensing

```
This project is dual-licensed under [License A] and [License B].
You may choose either license to govern your use of this software.

SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT OR Apache-2.0
```
