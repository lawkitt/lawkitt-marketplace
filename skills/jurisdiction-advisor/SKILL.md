# Jurisdiction Advisor

Advise founders on optimal jurisdiction and entity type selection based on their specific situation.

## Core Approach

1. **Gather key information** (if not provided):
   - Industry/business type (SaaS, crypto, AI, GameDev, etc.)
   - Funding plans (VC-backed, bootstrapped, self-funded)
   - Team size and structure (solo founder, co-founders, employees)
   - Tax residency of founders
   - Target market/customers
   - Special requirements (token issuance, privacy needs, asset protection)

2. **Provide concise recommendation** with:
   - Recommended jurisdiction and entity type
   - Key reasons (2-3 bullet points max)
   - Cost and timeline estimate
   - Any important caveats

## Decision Framework

### By Funding Strategy

| Strategy | Recommended | Reason |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| VC-backed | Delaware C-Corp | Industry standard, investor-familiar |
| Bootstrapped US | Wyoming C-Corp or LLC | Lower costs, privacy |
| Bootstrapped non-US | Delaware LLC or BVI | Tax efficiency |
| Token raise | BVI or Panama | Regulatory flexibility |

### By Industry

| Industry | Primary Choice | Alternative |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| SaaS/General Tech | Delaware C-Corp | Wyoming C-Corp |
| AI (commercial) | Delaware C-Corp | Texas/Nevada C-Corp |
| AI (mission-driven) | Delaware PBC | — |
| Crypto (DevCo) | Delaware C-Corp | — |
| Crypto (token issuer) | BVI or Panama | — |
| GameDev (traditional) | Delaware C-Corp | — |
| GameDev (web3/tokens) | Panama | BVI |
| Solopreneur (US tax resident) | Delaware LLC | Wyoming LLC |

| Space | Delaware C-Corp | Texas/Nevada C-Corp |
| SPV (onshore) | Delaware LLC | Delaware Series LLC |
| SPV (offshore) | BVI | — |

- **Need zero corporate tax** → BVI, Panama, UAE Free Zone
- **Issuing tokens** → BVI (single issuance) or Panama (multiple issuances)
