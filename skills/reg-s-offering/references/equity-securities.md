# Special Rules for Equity Securities

This reference covers the special requirements and considerations for equity securities offerings under Regulation S, with particular focus on the stringent Category 3 requirements that apply to most equity offerings.

---

## Overview

Equity securities offerings under Regulation S face more stringent requirements than debt offerings, particularly in Category 3:

| Aspect | Equity Securities | Debt Securities |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Category 3 DCP | 6 months (reporting) / 12 months (non-reporting) | 40 days |
| SUSMI determination | Based on trading volume | Based on U.S. holders of record |
| Transactional restrictions | Extensive (certifications, legends, transfer restrictions) | Global note/certification |
| Flowback concerns | Higher (equity has broader retail appeal) | Lower (institutional market) |

---

## Category Determination for Equity

### Category 1 (Fewest Restrictions)

Equity securities qualify for Category 1 ONLY if:
- The issuer is a **foreign issuer with no SUSMI** in the equity securities, OR
- The offering is an **overseas directed offering**, OR
- The securities are issued for non-cash consideration (employee plans, M&A, etc.)

**SUSMI for Equity** exists if either:
1. U.S. securities exchanges/inter-dealer systems constitute the **single largest market** for the equity class, OR
2. **20%+ of worldwide trading** occurs in U.S. markets AND less than 55% occurs in a single foreign market

### Category 2 (Moderate Restrictions)

Equity securities fall into Category 2 ONLY if:
- The issuer is a **reporting foreign private issuer**

### Category 3 (Most Stringent)

Equity securities fall into Category 3 if:
- The issuer is a **U.S. issuer** (whether reporting or non-reporting), OR
- The issuer is a **non-reporting foreign issuer with SUSMI**

**Key Point**: Most equity offerings involving U.S. companies or significant U.S. market interest will be Category 3.

## Category 3 Equity Requirements (Detailed)

Category 3 imposes the most comprehensive set of requirements for equity securities.

### Distribution Compliance Period (DCP)

| Issuer Status | DCP Length |
|---------------|------------|
| Reporting issuer (files 10-K, 20-F, etc.) | **6 months** |

Each certificate (or book-entry position) must bear a legend stating:
- The securities have not been registered under the Securities Act
- Transfer is prohibited except in accordance with Regulation S, registration, or another exemption
- Hedging transactions may not be conducted unless in compliance with the Securities Act

**5. Transfer Restrictions**

The issuer must implement transfer restrictions through:

- Foreign issuers with SUSMI

Distributors making offers or sales prior to DCP expiration must either:

## Legend and Certification Examples

### Sample Securities Legend (Category 3)

```
THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED
UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT"), OR
THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD, PLEDGED,
OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT (1) PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM
REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR (2) PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE
REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, IN EACH CASE IN ACCORDANCE
WITH ALL APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS AND THE SECURITIES LAWS OF OTHER
JURISDICTIONS, AND IN THE CASE OF A TRANSACTION EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION,
UNLESS THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED AN OPINION OF COUNSEL REASONABLY SATISFACTORY
TO IT THAT SUCH TRANSACTION DOES NOT REQUIRE REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES
ACT AND SUCH OTHER APPLICABLE LAWS. HEDGING TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THESE
SECURITIES MAY NOT BE CONDUCTED UNLESS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE SECURITIES ACT.
```

### Sample Purchaser Certification

## Convertible Securities

### Treatment as Equity

Securities that are convertible into, exchangeable for, or represent the right to acquire equity securities are generally treated as **equity** for Regulation S purposes. This includes:

- Convertible preferred stock
- Convertible bonds/notes
- Warrants
- Stock options
- Rights offerings
- Exchangeable securities

### Implications

| Security Type | Regulation S Treatment | Category (U.S. Issuer) |
|---------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Common stock | Equity | Category 3 |
| Preferred stock | Equity | Category 3 |
| Convertible bonds | Equity | Category 3 |
| Warrants | Equity | Category 3 |
| Non-convertible debt | Debt | Category 2 (if reporting) |

### DCP for Convertible Securities

For a U.S. issuer's convertible notes:
- DCP is **6 months** (if reporting) or **12 months** (if non-reporting)
- NOT the 40-day period applicable to straight debt

---

## Depositary Receipts

### American Depositary Receipts (ADRs)

ADRs are U.S. securities representing shares of foreign companies. For Regulation S purposes:

- ADRs are **equity securities**
- The **underlying shares** offered by a foreign issuer may qualify for Category 1 or 2
- ADR programs themselves involve U.S. registration considerations

### Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs)

GDRs are depositary receipts traded on non-U.S. exchanges:

- GDRs follow the category of the underlying equity
- A foreign issuer offering GDRs may qualify for Category 1 (if no SUSMI) or Category 2 (if reporting)

---

## Equity-Linked Instruments

### Principal-Protected Notes

Notes whose return is linked to equity performance:
- Generally treated as **equity** due to economic exposure
- Category 3 for U.S. issuers

### Equity Swaps

Swap agreements with equity exposure:
- The swap itself may not be a "security"
- However, any securities issued or transferred in connection with the swap must comply with Regulation S

### Employee Stock Options

Stock options issued to employees:
- May qualify for Category 1 if part of a compensatory plan and issued for non-cash consideration
- If sold for cash to non-employees: standard category analysis applies

---

## SUSMI Analysis for Equity

### When to Perform SUSMI Analysis

SUSMI must be analyzed when:
- The issuer is a foreign issuer
- Determining whether Category 1 is available
- Analysis should be performed no more than **60 days before** the offering commences

### Data Sources

Trading volume data may be obtained from:
- Stock exchanges (official trading statistics)
- Financial data providers (Bloomberg, Reuters, etc.)
- Regulatory filings (if available)

### SUSMI Tests (Equity)

**Test 1: Single Largest Market**
- Calculate trading volume on each market for the relevant period
- If U.S. markets = largest market → SUSMI exists

**Test 2: 20%/55% Test**
- Calculate: U.S. trading volume ÷ Total worldwide volume
- Calculate: Largest foreign market volume ÷ Total worldwide volume
- If U.S. ≥ 20% AND largest foreign < 55% → SUSMI exists

### Practical Example

| Market | Trading Volume | Percentage |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| London Stock Exchange | $500M | 50% |
| U.S. OTC Markets | $250M | 25% |
| Frankfurt | $150M | 15% |
| Other | $100M | 10% |
| **Total** | **$1B** | **100%** |

**Analysis**:
- Test 1: LSE (50%) is largest, not U.S. → Test 1 not triggered
- Test 2: U.S. (25%) ≥ 20% AND LSE (50%) < 55% → **SUSMI exists**
- **Result**: Category 1 NOT available

## Post-DCP Considerations

### After DCP Expiration

Once the DCP expires:
- Transactional restrictions generally cease
- Securities may be resold more freely under Rule 904
- However, securities remain "restricted securities" for U.S. law purposes

### Resale into the United States

After DCP, securities may be resold to U.S. persons only:
- Pursuant to registration
- Under Rule 144 (if holding period satisfied)
- Under Rule 144A (to QIBs)
- Under Section 4(a)(1½) (private resales)

### Legend Removal

Legends may be removed when:
- Securities are registered
- Securities qualify for Rule 144 resale (typically after 6 months for reporting issuers, 1 year for non-reporting)
- Legal opinion confirms exemption availability

---

## Flowback Prevention

### What is Flowback?

"Flowback" refers to securities sold offshore under Regulation S finding their way back to U.S. investors before the DCP expires or without compliance with U.S. law.

### Why Flowback Matters

- Undermines the territorial basis of Regulation S
- Could result in loss of safe harbor protection
- May expose issuer and distributors to Section 5 liability

### Anti-Flowback Measures

**Documentation Controls**:
- Subscription agreements requiring non-U.S. person representations
- Selling restrictions in underwriting agreement
- Legends on securities

**Transfer Controls**:
- Stop transfer instructions to transfer agent
- Registrar procedures requiring certification
- Book-entry restrictions through custodians

**Market Controls**:
- Selling only through offshore distribution channels
- Restricting placement to known non-U.S. institutional investors
- Monitoring secondary market trading
