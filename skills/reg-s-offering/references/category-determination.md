# Category Determination Guide

This guide helps determine which category of the Issuer Safe Harbor (Rule 903) applies to a particular securities offering under Regulation S.

---

## Overview of the Three Categories

| Category | Risk Level | Restrictions | Typical Issuers |
|----------|------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Category 1** | Lowest risk of flowback | Fewest restrictions | Foreign issuers (no SUSMI), overseas directed offerings |
| **Category 2** | Moderate risk | Moderate restrictions | Reporting issuers, foreign issuer debt |
| **Category 3** | Highest risk | Most stringent | U.S. issuers (equity), non-reporting foreign issuers with SUSMI |

---

## Category Determination Flowchart

### Step 1: Does Category 1 Apply?

Answer the following questions:

**Question 1A: Is this an overseas directed offering?**
- Is the offering directed to residents of a single foreign country?
- Is it conducted in accordance with that country's local laws?
- Is the principal trading market in that country OR are there no selling commissions outside that country?

→ If YES to all: **Category 1 applies**

**Question 1B: Is the issuer a foreign issuer with no SUSMI?**
- Is the issuer a "foreign private issuer" under Rule 405?
- For equity: Is there no substantial U.S. market interest in this class of securities?
- For debt: Is there no SUSMI in the issuer's debt securities?

→ If YES to all: **Category 1 applies**

**Question 1C: Is this a special Category 1 transaction?**
- Securities backed by foreign government full faith and credit?
- Employee benefit plan securities (non-cash consideration)?
- M&A exchange offer securities?
- Securities issued in a reorganization?

→ If YES to any: **Category 1 applies**

If none of the above → Proceed to Step 2

---

### Step 2: Does Category 2 Apply?

**Question 2A: Is the issuer a reporting company?**
- Does the issuer file reports under Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act?
- (For foreign issuers: Files 20-F, 40-F, or is registered under Section 12)

**Question 2B: What type of security is being offered?**

| Issuer Status | Security Type | Category |
|---------------|---------------|----------|
| Reporting foreign issuer | Equity | **Category 2** |
| Reporting foreign issuer | Debt | **Category 2** |
| Reporting U.S. issuer | Debt | **Category 2** |
| Non-reporting foreign issuer | Debt | **Category 2** |
| Reporting U.S. issuer | Equity | Category 3 |
| Non-reporting foreign issuer (with SUSMI) | Equity | Category 3 |
| Non-reporting U.S. issuer | Debt | Category 3 |

If Category 2 applies based on the table above → **Category 2**

If not → Proceed to Step 3

---

### Step 3: Category 3 (Default)

If the offering does not qualify for Category 1 or Category 2, then **Category 3** applies.

Typical Category 3 situations:
- Equity of U.S. issuers (reporting or non-reporting)
- Equity of non-reporting foreign issuers with SUSMI
- Debt of non-reporting U.S. issuers

## Key Factors Explained

### Factor 1: Issuer Nationality

**U.S. Issuer**: A company organized or incorporated under the laws of any U.S. state, including Delaware.

**Foreign Issuer**: A company organized under the laws of a non-U.S. jurisdiction. To qualify as a "foreign private issuer" under Rule 405:
- Must NOT have more than 50% of voting securities held by U.S. residents, OR
- If more than 50% U.S. held, must NOT have majority of officers/directors be U.S. citizens/residents AND must NOT have more than 50% of assets in the U.S. AND business must NOT be principally administered in the U.S.

### Factor 2: Reporting Status

**Reporting Issuer**: An issuer that files periodic reports under:
- Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K for domestic issuers; 20-F, 6-K for foreign private issuers)
- Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act

**Non-Reporting Issuer**: An issuer that does not file Exchange Act reports. Note that an issuer may have filed a registration statement under the Securities Act without becoming a reporting company.

### Factor 3: Substantial U.S. Market Interest (SUSMI)

**For Equity** – SUSMI exists if either:
1. U.S. markets constitute the single largest market for the class of equity securities, OR
2. 20%+ of worldwide trading occurs in U.S. markets AND less than 55% occurs in a single foreign market

**For Debt** – SUSMI exists if any of:
1. 300+ U.S. persons hold the debt of record
2. $1 billion+ principal is held by U.S. persons of record
3. 20%+ of outstanding principal is held by U.S. persons of record

### Factor 4: Type of Security

**Equity Securities**: Common stock, preferred stock, convertible securities, warrants, options.

**Debt Securities**: Bonds, notes, debentures, and other evidence of indebtedness. For Regulation S purposes, convertible debt is generally treated as equity.

---

## Special Situations

### Convertible Securities

Convertible debt and other securities with embedded equity features are generally treated as **equity securities** for category determination purposes. This means:
- Convertible debt of a U.S. issuer → Category 3
- Convertible debt of a non-reporting foreign issuer with SUSMI → Category 3

### Equity-Linked Notes

Equity-linked notes (e.g., exchangeable notes, principal-protected notes linked to equity indices) may be treated as equity for Regulation S purposes, depending on their structure.

### Asset-Backed Securities

ABS offerings may qualify for Category 1 if:
- The issuer is a foreign SPV with no SUSMI in its securities, OR
- The offering qualifies as an overseas directed offering

### Hybrid Instruments

For hybrid instruments with both debt and equity characteristics, the more restrictive category typically applies. Legal analysis of the specific instrument is required.

---

## SUSMI Determination Process

### For Equity Securities

**Step 1**: Identify all markets where the equity trades

**Step 2**: Calculate trading volume percentages:
- Total U.S. trading volume ÷ Total worldwide trading volume = U.S. percentage
- Largest single foreign market volume ÷ Total worldwide trading volume = Foreign percentage

**Step 3**: Apply the tests:
- Test A: Is U.S. the single largest market? → If YES, SUSMI exists
- Test B: Is U.S. ≥ 20% AND single largest foreign market < 55%? → If YES, SUSMI exists

**Step 4**: Timing:
- Determination must be made no more than **60 days before** offering commencement

### For Debt Securities

**Step 1**: Identify all holders of record of issuer's debt securities

**Step 2**: Determine how many are U.S. persons and the amount they hold

**Step 3**: Apply the tests:
- ≥ 300 U.S. persons hold of record? → SUSMI exists
- ≥ $1 billion held by U.S. persons of record? → SUSMI exists
- ≥ 20% of outstanding principal held by U.S. persons of record? → SUSMI exists

**Step 4**: Timing:
- Determination made as of most recent **fiscal year-end**
