## Phase 1: Pre-Offering Analysis

### 1.1 Issuer Classification

- [ ] **Determine issuer nationality**
  - Is the issuer incorporated/organized under U.S. law? → U.S. Issuer
  - Is the issuer incorporated/organized under non-U.S. law? → Potentially Foreign Issuer

- [ ] **For non-U.S. entities, confirm Foreign Private Issuer status**
  - Less than 50% of voting securities held by U.S. residents? → FPI likely
  - If 50%+ U.S. held, does the issuer FAIL all three of these tests?
    - Majority of officers/directors are NOT U.S. citizens/residents
    - More than 50% of assets are NOT in the U.S.
    - Business is NOT principally administered in the U.S.
  - If all three tests failed → Still qualifies as FPI

- [ ] **Determine Exchange Act reporting status**
  - Does the issuer file reports under Section 13(a) or 15(d)?
  - What forms? (10-K, 20-F, 40-F, etc.)

### 1.2 Security Classification

- [ ] **Identify the type of security**

  - All non-U.S. exchanges where securities trade
  - Period: Prior fiscal year or period since incorporation

- [ ] **Apply SUSMI tests**
  - Test 1: Is U.S. the single largest market? Yes / No
  - Test 2: Is U.S. ≥ 20% AND largest foreign market < 55%? Yes / No
  - If either YES → SUSMI exists

**For Debt Securities**:

- [ ] **Determine U.S. holder statistics** (as of most recent fiscal year-end)
  - Number of U.S. persons holding of record: _______
  - Principal amount held by U.S. persons of record: $_______
  - Percentage of outstanding principal held by U.S. persons: _______%

- [ ] **Apply SUSMI tests**
  - ≥ 300 U.S. persons hold of record? Yes / No
  - ≥ $1 billion held by U.S. persons of record? Yes / No
  - ≥ 20% of principal held by U.S. persons of record? Yes / No

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Directed Selling Efforts**: Inadvertent U.S. marketing through websites, press releases, or social media

2. **U.S. Person Sales During DCP**: Selling to U.S. persons before DCP expires (even if they are located offshore)

3. **Missing Documentation**: Failing to collect purchaser certifications/agreements before sale

4. **Legend Omissions**: Issuing securities without required legends

5. **Premature Legend Removal**: Removing legends before DCP expires or exemption is available

6. **SUSMI Miscalculation**: Incorrectly determining SUSMI status leads to wrong category

7. **Convertible Security Misclassification**: Treating convertible debt as debt instead of equity

8. **Integration Issues**: Concurrent U.S. private placement not properly separated from Regulation S offering

9. **Inadequate Transfer Controls**: Transfer agent not properly instructed on restrictions

10. **Record Keeping Failures**: Insufficient documentation to demonstrate compliance
