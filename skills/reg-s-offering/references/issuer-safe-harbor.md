# Issuer Safe Harbor (Rule 903)

The Issuer Safe Harbor under Rule 903 provides a safe harbor from Section 5 registration requirements for offers and sales by **issuers, distributors, their respective affiliates, and persons acting on their behalf**.

---

## General Conditions (All Categories)

Every transaction relying on the Issuer Safe Harbor must satisfy these two fundamental conditions:

### 1. Offshore Transaction

The offer or sale must be made in an "offshore transaction" as defined in Rule 902(h):
- The offer is NOT made to a person in the United States, AND
- Either:
  - At the time the buy order is originated, the buyer is outside the United States (or the seller reasonably believes so), OR
  - The transaction is executed through a designated offshore securities market and is not pre-arranged with a U.S. buyer

### 2. No Directed Selling Efforts

No "directed selling efforts" may be made in the United States. This means no activities undertaken for the purpose of, or that could reasonably be expected to have the effect of, conditioning the U.S. market for the securities.

## Category 1 – Lowest Risk Transactions

### Who Qualifies for Category 1?

Category 1 applies to offers and sales of securities of:

1. **Foreign issuers with no SUSMI** – Foreign issuers where there is no substantial U.S. market interest in the class of securities being offered (for equity) or in the issuer's debt (for debt securities)

2. **Overseas directed offerings** – Offerings directed to residents of a single foreign country in accordance with that country's local laws and practices, where:
   - The principal trading market for the securities is in that country
   - OR there are no selling commissions (other than to distributors or selling agents in that country) and no promotional activities in connection with the sale

3. **Certain government securities** – Offers and sales of securities backed by the full faith and credit of foreign governments

4. **Securities sold for consideration other than cash** – Offers and sales in connection with employee benefit plans, in exchange for securities in M&A transactions, or in exchange for securities in reorganizations

### Category 1 Requirements

| Requirement | Applicable to Category 1? |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| Offshore transaction | **Yes** |
| No directed selling efforts | **Yes** |

### Transactional Restrictions (Category 3)

Category 3 imposes the most stringent transactional restrictions:

   - It is not a U.S. person
   - It is not acquiring the securities for the account or benefit of any U.S. person
   - If it is a distributor, dealer, or person receiving a selling concession, it agrees to resell only in accordance with Regulation S, registration, or another exemption

3. **Purchaser agreement**: The purchaser must agree to resell only in accordance with Regulation S, pursuant to registration, or pursuant to another exemption, and shall not engage in hedging transactions unless in compliance with the Securities Act

4. **Legend requirement**: Securities must bear a legend stating:
   - The securities have not been registered
   - Transfer is prohibited except in accordance with Regulation S, pursuant to registration, or pursuant to another exemption
   - Hedging transactions may not be conducted unless in compliance with the Securities Act

5. **Transfer restrictions**: The issuer must, by contract or articles of incorporation, by-laws, or comparable documents:
   - Refuse to register any transfer not made in accordance with Regulation S, pursuant to registration, or pursuant to another exemption
   - For equity of non-reporting issuers: implement stop transfer instructions

6. **Confirmation of foreign status**: For offerings of equity securities of U.S. issuers or foreign issuers with SUSMI by distributors making offers or sales prior to expiration of the DCP:
   - Either the purchaser must be a distributor or dealer, OR
   - The seller must receive a written confirmation that the buyer and any person for whose account the buyer is acting is not a U.S. person

#### For Debt Securities:

2. **Debt securities must be represented upon issuance by**:
   - A temporary global security that is not exchangeable for definitive securities until the expiration of the 40-day DCP AND
   - Only upon certification that beneficial interests are owned either by non-U.S. persons or by U.S. persons who purchased in a registered transaction or pursuant to an exemption

3. **Book-entry systems**: If debt securities are held through Euroclear, Clearstream, or DTC, the temporary global security procedures above apply

## Interaction with Other Exemptions

### Regulation S and Rule 144A

A common structure combines:
- **Regulation S tranche**: For non-U.S. investors
- **Rule 144A tranche**: For U.S. qualified institutional buyers (QIBs)

This structure allows broad distribution while maintaining compliance with U.S. securities laws.

### Integration

The SEC has taken the position that offshore transactions made in compliance with Regulation S should not be integrated with registered domestic offerings or private placements under Section 4(a)(2). However:
- The resale provisions of Regulation S may be relevant
- Securities issued in a Regulation S offering may be "restricted securities" for purposes of Rule 144

### Effect on Resales

Securities sold in reliance on the Issuer Safe Harbor:
- Are "restricted securities" as defined in Rule 144 if sold to U.S. persons or for the account of U.S. persons
- May be resold using the Resale Safe Harbor (Rule 904)
- May be resold in the United States after the DCP expires if in compliance with applicable resale provisions
