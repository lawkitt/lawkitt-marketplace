# Resale Safe Harbor (Rule 904)

The Resale Safe Harbor under Rule 904 provides a safe harbor from Section 5 registration requirements for resales of securities by persons OTHER than the issuer, distributors, their respective affiliates, or persons acting on their behalf.

---

## Who Can Use the Resale Safe Harbor?

Rule 904 is available to any person who is NOT:
- The issuer
- A distributor
- An affiliate of the issuer or distributor
- A person acting on behalf of any of the above

**Typical users include**:
- Investors reselling previously acquired securities
- Dealers acting as principals (not as part of the distribution)
- Market makers in offshore markets

---

## General Conditions (All Resales)

Every resale relying on Rule 904 must satisfy the same two fundamental conditions as the Issuer Safe Harbor:

### 1. Offshore Transaction

The offer or sale must be made in an "offshore transaction" as defined in Rule 902(h):
- The offer is NOT made to a person in the United States, AND
- Either:
  - At the time the buy order is originated, the buyer is outside the United States (or the seller reasonably believes so), OR
  - The transaction is executed through a designated offshore securities market and is not pre-arranged with a U.S. buyer

### 2. No Directed Selling Efforts

No "directed selling efforts" may be made in the United States in connection with the resale.

---

## Additional Conditions for Certain Sellers

While most resellers need only satisfy the general conditions, **certain sellers** have additional requirements:

### Dealers and Persons Receiving Selling Concessions

If the seller is a **dealer** or a **person receiving a selling concession, fee, or other remuneration** in connection with the resale, additional conditions apply during the **distribution compliance period** of any Regulation S offering of the same class of securities:

1. **No knowing sales to U.S. persons**: Neither the seller nor any person acting on its behalf may know that the offeree or buyer is a U.S. person

2. **Broker's transaction requirement**: If the securities are of a domestic issuer or equity securities of a reporting foreign issuer (or of a foreign issuer with SUSMI), the sale must be made in a "broker's transaction" as described in Section 4(a)(4) of the Securities Act, or in a transaction comparable to such a transaction under local law or practice

### Officers and Directors (and Others Closely Associated with the Issuer)

If the seller is an **officer or director** of the issuer or distributor (or other person performing similar functions), additional conditions apply:

1. **No selling concessions**: The seller may not receive any selling concession, fee, or other remuneration in connection with the resale

2. **Compliance awareness**: The seller must know that the offeree or buyer, and any person acting on its behalf, is not a U.S. person

---

## Resales During the Distribution Compliance Period

Special attention is required for resales made during an ongoing distribution compliance period:

### What Triggers DCP Concerns?

If securities of the same class as those being resold are simultaneously being offered in a Regulation S offering with a DCP, resellers should be aware that:

1. Their resale could be viewed as part of the distribution
2. Additional requirements may apply to dealers and remunerated persons

### Timing Considerations

| Resale Timing | Practical Implication |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Before DCP starts | Standard Rule 904 conditions apply |
| During DCP | Additional requirements for certain sellers; heightened scrutiny |
| After DCP ends | Standard Rule 904 conditions apply; DCP-related restrictions lifted |

---

## Securities Acquired in Regulation S Offerings

Securities initially issued in a Regulation S offering may be freely resold offshore using Rule 904, subject to the following considerations:

### Equity Securities (Category 3 Offerings)

If equity securities were issued in a Category 3 Regulation S offering:

1. **During the DCP**: Resales must comply with any contractual restrictions agreed to at purchase (e.g., purchaser agreements restricting resales)

2. **Legends**: Securities may bear legends restricting transfer; transfers may require certification or legal opinions

3. **After DCP**: Once the DCP expires, securities may generally be resold offshore under Rule 904 without the Category 3 transactional restrictions

### Debt Securities

Debt securities issued under Regulation S are typically held through clearing systems (Euroclear, Clearstream, DTC) and represented by global securities. Resales are generally effected through book-entry transfers, with:

- Certification requirements during the DCP
- Conversion to definitive securities available after DCP expiration

---

## Resales into the United States

### General Rule

Rule 904 does NOT provide a safe harbor for resales into the United States. Resales to U.S. persons or in the United States require an exemption or registration.

### Available Exemptions for U.S. Resales

| Exemption | Requirements | Typical Use |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Registration** | Full Section 5 compliance | Public offerings |
| **Rule 144** | Holding period (6 months reporting / 1 year non-reporting); volume limits for affiliates; manner of sale requirements | Resales by holders after holding period |
| **Rule 144A** | Sales to QIBs only; securities must not be of same class as exchange-listed securities | Institutional market |
| **Section 4(a)(1½)** | Private resale that would qualify under Section 4(a)(2) if by the issuer | Sophisticated investors |

### Restricted Securities Status

Securities sold under Regulation S are "restricted securities" under Rule 144 when acquired by U.S. persons or for the account of U.S. persons. This affects:

- Holding period calculations for Rule 144
- Legend and stop-transfer requirements
- Resale planning

### Rule 144 Holding Period

For securities initially issued in a Regulation S offering:

- The **holding period** for Rule 144 purposes generally begins when the securities are first sold to a non-affiliate purchaser in a transaction not involving a public offering
- For Category 3 equity offerings: holding period may be calculated from the time of initial offshore sale, but specific facts should be analyzed

---

## Rule 144A Resales

### Complementary Use with Regulation S

A common structure allows securities initially offered under Regulation S to be resold in the United States to QIBs under Rule 144A:

1. **Initial offering**: Securities sold offshore under Regulation S
2. **U.S. resales**: Securities resold to QIBs under Rule 144A

### Requirements for Rule 144A Resales

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Purchaser qualification** | Buyer must be a "qualified institutional buyer" (QIB) |
| **Non-fungibility** | Securities must not be of the same class as securities listed on a U.S. exchange |
| **Information availability** | For non-reporting issuers: basic issuer information must be available upon request |
| **Seller's role** | Seller cannot be the issuer |

### Integration Concerns

The SEC has indicated that Regulation S and Rule 144A offerings may generally be conducted concurrently without integration concerns, provided:
- Each offering satisfies its own requirements
- Appropriate procedures prevent "flowback" of Regulation S securities to non-QIB U.S. persons

## Common Resale Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Non-U.S. Investor Reselling Offshore

**Situation**: A European investor purchased securities in a Regulation S offering and wishes to resell to another European investor.

**Analysis**:
- Seller is not issuer, distributor, or affiliate → Rule 904 available
- Both parties outside U.S. → Offshore transaction satisfied
- No U.S. marketing → No directed selling efforts
- **Result**: Standard Rule 904 resale; only general conditions apply

### Scenario 2: Dealer Acting as Market Maker

**Situation**: A London-based dealer makes a market in securities originally issued under Regulation S.

**Analysis**:
- Dealer receives compensation → Additional conditions apply during DCP
- Must not knowingly sell to U.S. persons during DCP
- If securities are of U.S. issuer, sales must be in "broker's transactions"
- **Result**: Rule 904 available with enhanced conditions during DCP

### Scenario 3: U.S. Person Seeks to Acquire Offshore

**Situation**: A U.S. investment fund wants to purchase securities in the offshore secondary market.

**Analysis**:
- Rule 904 safe harbor is for the seller, not the buyer
- Seller must satisfy offshore transaction requirement
- If seller knows buyer is U.S. person: offshore transaction may not be satisfied (unless conducted through designated offshore market without pre-arrangement)
- Buyer should consider its own compliance requirements
- **Result**: Careful structuring needed; legal counsel advised

### Scenario 4: Resale to QIB Under Rule 144A

**Situation**: A holder of Regulation S securities wants to sell to a U.S. hedge fund (QIB).

**Analysis**:
- Rule 904 does not cover U.S. sales
- Rule 144A may be available if:
  - Buyer is a QIB
  - Securities are not same class as U.S.-listed securities
  - Information requirements are met
- **Result**: Rule 144A resale may be available; verify all requirements

## Summary: Rule 904 Requirements

| Seller Type | Requirements |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Regular investor** | Offshore transaction + no directed selling efforts |
| **Dealer / remunerated person** (during DCP) | Above + no knowing sales to U.S. persons + broker's transaction (for certain securities) |
| **Officer / director** | Above + no selling concessions |

---

## Practical Guidance for Resellers

1. **Verify seller status**: Determine if you are a regular reseller or subject to enhanced requirements

2. **Check DCP status**: Determine if any Regulation S offering of the same class is still within its distribution compliance period

3. **Confirm offshore transaction**: Ensure the transaction qualifies as an "offshore transaction" under Rule 902(h)

4. **Avoid U.S. marketing**: Do not engage in any activities that could condition the U.S. market

5. **Document the transaction**: Maintain records demonstrating compliance with Rule 904

6. **Consider U.S. resale options**: If resale to U.S. persons is desired, analyze Rule 144, Rule 144A, or registration alternatives
