# Key Definitions Under Regulation S

This reference provides detailed explanations of the key defined terms used in Regulation S. Understanding these definitions is critical for determining eligibility and compliance requirements.

## U.S. Person

**Rule 902(k)** defines "U.S. person" to include:

### Included in Definition

1. **Natural persons** resident in the United States
2. **Partnerships and corporations** organized or incorporated under U.S. law
3. **Estates** where the executor or administrator is a U.S. person (unless governed by foreign law and having a non-U.S. professional fiduciary with sole investment discretion)
4. **Trusts** where:
   - A trustee is a U.S. person, OR
   - A U.S. person has the power to control all substantial trust decisions (unless having a non-U.S. professional fiduciary with sole investment discretion and no beneficiary is a U.S. person)
5. **Agencies or branches** of a non-U.S. entity located in the United States
6. **Non-discretionary accounts** held by a dealer or fiduciary for the benefit or account of a U.S. person
7. **Discretionary accounts** held by a dealer or fiduciary organized, incorporated, or resident in the United States
8. **Partnerships and corporations** organized outside the United States by a U.S. person principally for investing in unregistered securities (unless organized by accredited investors who are not natural persons, estates, or trusts)

### Excluded from Definition

1. Agencies or branches of U.S. persons located outside the United States if:
   - Operating for valid business reasons
   - Engaged in the business of insurance or banking
   - Subject to substantive regulation in the banking/insurance business in the jurisdiction where located

2. International organizations and their agencies, affiliates, and pension plans

3. Employee benefit plans established and administered in accordance with the laws of a non-U.S. jurisdiction and customary practice and documentation of such country

4. Estates or trusts where income is not subject to U.S. income tax regardless of source

### Practical Notes

- The determination of "U.S. person" status is fact-specific
- A purchaser's representation regarding non-U.S. person status is typically required
- "Look-through" may be required for certain entities to determine beneficial ownership

## Offshore Transaction

**Rule 902(h)** provides that an offer or sale is made in an "offshore transaction" if:

### Two-Prong Test

**Prong 1**: The offer is NOT made to a person in the United States

AND

**Prong 2**: Either:
- **(a)** At the time the buy order is originated, the buyer is outside the United States (or the seller reasonably believes the buyer is outside the United States), OR
- **(b)** The transaction is executed in, on, or through the facilities of a designated offshore securities market and neither the seller nor any person acting on its behalf knows that the transaction has been pre-arranged with a buyer in the United States

### Key Considerations

- For **Prong 2(a)**: The seller must have reasonable belief—mere reliance on representations without further inquiry may be insufficient if there are red flags
- For **Prong 2(b)**: Requires use of a "designated offshore securities market" per Rule 902(b) (includes major foreign exchanges like LSE, Tokyo, Hong Kong, etc.)
- The "pre-arranged" exception prevents circumvention through wash sales or coordinated transactions

### Designated Offshore Securities Markets

Rule 902(b) lists designated offshore securities markets including:
- Euronext (Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon, Paris)
- Australian Securities Exchange
- Frankfurt Stock Exchange
- Hong Kong Stock Exchange
- London Stock Exchange
- NASDAQ Europe
- Tokyo Stock Exchange
- Toronto Stock Exchange
- And many others

## Directed Selling Efforts

**Rule 902(c)** defines "directed selling efforts" as any activity undertaken for the purpose of, or that could reasonably be expected to have the effect of, conditioning the market in the United States for the securities being offered.

### Included Activities

Activities constituting directed selling efforts include:

1. **Mailing** printed materials to U.S. investors
2. **Conducting** promotional seminars in the United States
3. **Placing** advertisements with radio or television stations reaching the United States, or in publications with a general circulation in the United States
4. **Press releases** distributed in the United States

### Excluded Activities (Not Directed Selling Efforts)

1. **Advertising** required by foreign or U.S. law or by rules of a U.S. or foreign self-regulatory organization, provided it contains no more than:
   - Name of issuer
   - Title of security
   - Amount being offered
   - Name of underwriter(s)
   - Name of persons from whom offering circular may be obtained
   - Whether the selling restrictions apply

2. **Contact with persons excluded from the definition** of "U.S. person"

3. **Tombstone advertisements** in publications with less than 20% U.S. circulation

4. **Bona fide visits to real estate** by prospective investors prior to sales of securities issued by real estate companies

5. **Quotations** on designated offshore securities markets by a distributor acting as market maker

6. **Journalists' activities** – visits by journalists who publish abroad are excluded even if their publication has U.S. circulation (within limits)

### Practical Guidance

- Implement "offer territory" restrictions – documents and roadshows should be geographically restricted
- Website restrictions may be needed to block U.S. access during the offering period
- Press releases should be limited in scope and carefully drafted

## Substantial U.S. Market Interest (SUSMI)

**Rule 902(j)** defines when "substantial U.S. market interest" exists. SUSMI is relevant because it determines whether a foreign issuer's offering qualifies for Category 1 (no SUSMI) or must comply with Category 2 or 3 requirements.

### For Equity Securities

SUSMI exists if:

1. U.S. securities exchanges and inter-dealer quotation systems constitute the **single largest market** for the class of securities in the shorter of:
   - The issuer's prior fiscal year, OR
   - The period since the issuer's incorporation

2. **20% or more** of all trading in the class worldwide took place in, on, or through U.S. securities exchanges and inter-dealer quotation systems, and less than 55% took place through the markets of a single foreign country, measured by:
   - The most recent 12-month period for which data is available, OR
   - The period since the security's U.S. listing (if less than 12 months)

### For Debt Securities

SUSMI exists if:
- The debt securities are held of record by **300 or more U.S. persons**
- **$1 billion or more** principal amount is held of record by U.S. persons
- **20% or more** of the outstanding principal amount is held of record by U.S. persons

### Determination Timing

- For **equity**: SUSMI is determined as of a date no more than **60 days before** the commencement of the offering
- For **debt**: SUSMI is determined as of the **most recent fiscal year-end** (or period since formation if less than one fiscal year)

## Distribution Compliance Period (DCP)

The "distribution compliance period" is the period during which certain restrictions apply to prevent securities from flowing back to U.S. persons.

### DCP Lengths by Category and Security Type

| Category | Security Type | DCP Length |
|----------|--------------|------------|
| Category 1 | All securities | **None** |
| Category 2 | All securities | **40 days** |
| Category 3 | Equity of reporting issuers | **6 months** |
| Category 3 | Equity of non-reporting issuers | **12 months** |
| Category 3 | Debt securities | **40 days** |

### DCP Start Date

The distribution compliance period begins on:
- The **later of**: (i) the date the securities were first offered to persons other than distributors, or (ii) the date of closing of the offering

### During the DCP

Depending on the category, restrictions may include:
- Prohibitions on sales to U.S. persons
- Requirements for purchaser certifications
- Legend requirements on securities and offering documents
- Requirements for distributor agreements
- Restrictions on hedging transactions

---

## Distributor

**Rule 902(d)** defines "distributor" as any underwriter, dealer, or other person who participates, pursuant to a contractual arrangement, in the distribution of securities offered or sold in reliance on Regulation S.

### Key Points

- Includes both traditional underwriters and selling agents
- Requires a **contractual arrangement** – mere incidental participation may not qualify
- Distributors have specific obligations under Category 2 and 3 offerings:
  - Must agree to comply with Regulation S restrictions
  - Must agree to pass on restrictions to subsequent purchasers during DCP
  - May be required to send confirmation notices

---

## Foreign Private Issuer

**Rule 405** of the Securities Act defines "foreign private issuer" as any foreign government or any foreign corporation or other organization, UNLESS:

1. **More than 50%** of the issuer's outstanding voting securities are directly or indirectly held of record by U.S. residents, AND

2. **Any one** of the following:
   - The majority of executive officers or directors are U.S. citizens or residents
   - More than 50% of assets are located in the United States
   - The business is principally administered in the United States

### Significance

Foreign private issuers generally receive more favorable treatment under Regulation S (more likely to qualify for Category 1 or 2, rather than Category 3).

---

## Offering Restrictions

"Offering restrictions" are required for Category 2 and Category 3 offerings and include:

1. **Distributor Agreement**: Each distributor must agree in writing that all offers and sales during the DCP shall be made only in accordance with Regulation S, pursuant to registration, or pursuant to another available exemption

2. **Offering Document Legends**: All offering documents must contain statements to the effect that:
   - The securities have not been registered under the Securities Act
   - The securities may not be offered or sold in the United States or to U.S. persons unless registered or an exemption is available
   - Hedging transactions may not be conducted unless in compliance with the Securities Act

3. **Additional notices** may be required for certain Category 3 transactions
