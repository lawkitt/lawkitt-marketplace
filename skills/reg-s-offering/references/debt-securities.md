# Special Rules for Debt Securities

This reference covers the special requirements and considerations for debt securities offerings under Regulation S, including the TEFRA rules for bearer instruments.

---

## Overview

Debt securities offerings under Regulation S generally benefit from more favorable treatment than equity offerings:

| Aspect | Debt Securities | Equity Securities |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Category 3 DCP | 40 days | 6 months (reporting) / 12 months (non-reporting) |
| SUSMI determination | Based on U.S. holders of record | Based on trading volume |
| Additional restrictions | TEFRA compliance may apply | Purchaser certifications, legends, transfer restrictions |

---

## Category Determination for Debt

### Category 1 (Fewest Restrictions)

Debt securities qualify for Category 1 if:
- The issuer is a foreign issuer with no SUSMI in its debt securities

**SUSMI for Debt** exists if any of the following:
- 300 or more U.S. persons hold the debt of record
- $1 billion or more principal amount is held by U.S. persons of record
- 20% or more of the outstanding principal is held by U.S. persons of record

### Category 2 (Moderate Restrictions)

Debt securities fall into Category 2 if:
- The issuer is a **reporting issuer** (whether U.S. or foreign), OR
- The issuer is a **non-reporting foreign issuer** (debt of foreign issuers that are not reporting companies but do not qualify for Category 1)

### Category 3 (Most Stringent)

Debt securities fall into Category 3 only if:
- The issuer is a **non-reporting U.S. issuer**

---

## Category 3 Requirements for Debt

Even though Category 3 has the most stringent requirements, debt securities under Category 3 receive more favorable treatment than equity:

### Distribution Compliance Period

**40 days** (same as Category 2), compared to 6-12 months for equity

### Special Debt Requirements (Category 3)

Instead of the equity-specific requirements (purchaser certifications, legends, transfer restrictions), Category 3 debt must be represented by:

1. **Temporary Global Security**: A master note held by a clearing system that:
   - Is NOT exchangeable for definitive securities until after the 40-day DCP
   - Can only be exchanged upon **certification** that beneficial owners are:
     - Non-U.S. persons, OR
     - U.S. persons who purchased under registration or an exemption

2. **Clearing System Procedures**: If debt is held through Euroclear, Clearstream, or DTC:
   - Book-entry interests cannot be transferred to U.S. persons during DCP
   - Conversion to definitive form requires beneficial ownership certification

## TEFRA Rules Overview

The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA) imposes additional requirements on bearer debt instruments to ensure compliance with U.S. tax laws. Although bearer bonds are now rare, understanding TEFRA is important for certain offshore debt offerings.

### What is TEFRA?

TEFRA denies tax deductions for interest paid on bearer obligations that do not comply with certain requirements. There are two compliance regimes:

| Regime | Common Name | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| TEFRA C | "Foreign-Targeted" | Securities offered ONLY outside the United States |
| TEFRA D | "40-Day Rule" | Securities that may be offered to U.S. persons but subject to restrictions |

### TEFRA C Requirements

To comply with TEFRA C, the debt must be:

1. **Issued and delivered outside the United States**

2. **Principal and interest payable only outside the United States**

3. **Face of the obligation must state**:
   - Any U.S. person holding the obligation is subject to U.S. tax limitations

4. **No issuance to U.S. persons or in the United States**

5. **Procedures must be in place** to ensure compliance:
   - Offering documents must state that the securities are being offered only outside the United States
   - Selling restrictions must be included

### TEFRA D Requirements

TEFRA D applies to obligations that:
- Are part of an issue with a maturity over one year
- Are offered for sale during the 40-day restricted period

**Requirements**:

1. **Restricted Period**: For 40 days after issuance:
   - The obligation may not be offered or sold to a U.S. person or in the United States
   - The obligation may not be delivered in the United States

2. **Certification Requirement**:
   - Temporary global security may not be exchanged for definitive securities until:
     - After the 40-day restricted period, AND
     - Upon certification that the beneficial owner is NOT a U.S. person (or is a U.S. person who purchased through specified channels)

3. **Legend Requirement**:
   - The obligation must bear a legend stating that any U.S. person holding the obligation is subject to limitations under U.S. tax law

4. **Information Reporting**:
   - Interest payments to non-exempt persons may trigger information reporting requirements

### TEFRA and Regulation S Interaction

For many offshore debt offerings, both TEFRA and Regulation S requirements apply:

| Requirement | TEFRA D | Regulation S (Cat 2/3) |
|-------------|---------|------------------------|
| Restricted period | 40 days | 40 days (debt) |
| No U.S. sales during period | Yes | Yes |
| Certification for exchange | Yes | Yes (Cat 3) |
| Temporary global security | Typical | Required (Cat 3) |

**Practical Note**: Compliance with Regulation S Category 2 or 3 requirements for debt generally also satisfies TEFRA D, though issuers should confirm both sets of requirements are met.

## Global Notes and Clearing Systems

### Structure Overview

Modern offshore debt offerings typically use a **global note structure**:

1. **Temporary Global Note**: Issued at closing; represents all debt securities
2. **Permanent Global Note**: Exchanged for temporary note after DCP/restricted period
3. **Definitive Securities**: Available upon request after conversion to permanent global note (rare in practice)

### Role of Clearing Systems

Major international clearing systems facilitate trading:

| System | Headquarters | Function |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| **Euroclear** | Brussels | European clearing and settlement |
| **Clearstream** | Luxembourg | European clearing and settlement |
| **DTC** | New York | U.S. clearing and settlement |

**How it works**:
1. Global note deposited with common depositary (for Euroclear/Clearstream) or DTC
2. Beneficial interests recorded through book-entry
3. Transfers occur through the clearing system without physical movement
4. Certification requirements enforced through clearing system procedures

### Certification Process

During the 40-day restricted period:
- Beneficial interests may only be held in accounts of non-U.S. persons
- Transfers to U.S. person accounts are blocked
- After 40 days: beneficial owner certification allows exchange to permanent global note
- U.S. persons may then acquire interests if purchased through proper channels

## Convertible Debt Considerations

### General Rule

Convertible debt (bonds that can be converted into equity) is generally treated as **equity** for Regulation S purposes because of its equity-like characteristics.

### Implications

| Aspect | Plain Debt | Convertible Debt |
|--------|------------|------------------|
| Category determination | Based on debt rules | Based on equity rules |
| DCP (Category 3) | 40 days | 6 or 12 months |
| Transactional restrictions | Global note/certification | Full equity restrictions |
| SUSMI test | Debt SUSMI | Equity SUSMI |

### Why This Matters

A U.S. issuer offering convertible notes offshore:
- Cannot treat the offering as Category 2 debt
- Must comply with Category 3 equity requirements
- DCP is 6 months (if reporting) or 12 months (if non-reporting)
- Must include purchaser certifications, legends, transfer restrictions

## High-Yield Debt (Junk Bonds)

### Special Considerations

High-yield debt offerings often have specific features:

1. **Institutional focus**: Typically sold to sophisticated institutional investors
2. **Combined Reg S / 144A structure**: Common for high-yield offerings
3. **Registration rights**: Investors often receive rights to registered exchange offer

### Typical Structure

| Tranche | Offering Exemption | Investors |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| Regulation S | Rule 903 | Non-U.S. persons |
| Rule 144A | Rule 144A | U.S. QIBs |

### Registration Rights

Many high-yield offerings include:
- **A/B Exchange Offer**: Issuer files registration statement and offers to exchange unregistered notes for registered notes
- **Shelf Registration**: If exchange offer cannot be completed, issuer may be required to file a shelf registration statement for resales

---

## Sovereign and Quasi-Sovereign Debt

### Category 1 Treatment

Debt securities backed by the full faith and credit of a foreign government qualify for **Category 1**, regardless of:
- Where the securities trade
- Who holds the securities
- Whether the sovereign is a reporting entity

### Quasi-Sovereign Issuers

Government-related entities (SOEs, development banks, etc.) do NOT automatically qualify for Category 1. Analysis required:
- Is the debt guaranteed by the sovereign? → May qualify for Category 1
- Is it merely issued by a government-owned entity? → Standard category analysis applies
