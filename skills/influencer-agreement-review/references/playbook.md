## Lessons from Real Disputes (BK Case Analysis)

> The following fixes are based on BK's analysis of actual influencer lawsuits. Each addresses a specific contract failure that led to litigation.

| Case | Contract Failure | BK Fix |
|------|-----------------|--------|
| **Gymshark v. Massiah** | Non-compete too long, no separate payment | Limit to 0-6 months; pay separate compensation for restriction |
| **Luka Sabbat v. Snap** | Large upfront, no milestones | Milestone payments: 20% signing, 40% first post, 40% final |
| **Shein Class Actions** | Vague "comply with law" disclosure | Mandatory: "#ad" in first 3 lines + platform tools |
| **PopSugar** | Unlimited perpetual license | Time-limited (12mo), no sublicense without consent |
| **Celsius/ALO Yoga** | "Organic-style" posts allowed | Prohibited language list ("honest review", "not sponsored") |
| **Ferragni-Balocco** | Misleading charity claims | Exact charity language required verbatim |

---

## 1. Deliverables & Approval

**Why it matters:** Clear deliverables prevent scope creep. Unlimited revisions = free labor for Creator.

### Skala Standard
> "Influencer will create and publish Deliverables on Social Media Platforms following Campaign Start Date and upon Brand's written instructions. All Deliverables must meet Brand's quality standards and include required disclosures."

### Required Elements

| Element | Check For |
|---------|-----------|
| Content type | Posts, stories, videos, reels specified |
| Platforms | Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, etc. |
| Quantity | Number of each content type |
| Timeline | Campaign Start Date, posting schedule |
| Availability | How long content stays up |

### Negotiation Positions

| Preferred (Creator) | Fallback |
|---------------------|----------|
| Specific SOW with content types, platforms, quantity | Content brief attached as exhibit |
| 2-3 revisions maximum | "Reasonable revisions" with materiality standard |
| Creator approves final published version | 48-hour deemed approval |
| Rejection only for brand guideline violations | Written rejection with specific reasons |

### Skala: Material Technical Failure
> "If material technical failure prevents timely delivery, Influencer will notify Brand and, at Brand's option, reschedule or refund fees allocable to undelivered Deliverable."

---

## 2. Compensation & Payment

### Skala Standard
> "Brand will pay Influencer the Compensation as sole compensation for creating and publishing Deliverables... Payment due within Payment Term subject to receiving invoice."

### Red Flags
- Payment on publication only (Creator bears all risk)
- Net 90+ terms
- Unlimited offsets
- No invoice requirement

### Negotiation Positions

| Preferred (Creator) | Fallback |
|---------------------|----------|
| 50% signing, 50% delivery | 30/40/30 (signing/delivery/publication) |
| Net 30 days | Net 45 days |
| Late fee 1.5%/month | Statutory rate |
| No unilateral offsets | Offsets limited to documented breach |
| Pre-approved expenses documented | Expenses included in rate |

### Skala: AI Tools Costs
> "Influencer is solely responsible for all costs of any generative software, models, training data, platforms, or services ('AI Tools') used to generate and publish Deliverables."

---

## 3. Intellectual Property & Content Rights

### Skala Standard (Influencer-Favorable)
> "Influencer retains ownership of Deliverables and grants Brand a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid, sublicensable license to use, reproduce, publish, distribute, display, transmit, adapt, and otherwise exploit the Deliverables."

### Key Elements

| Element | Skala Standard |
|---------|---------------|
| Ownership | Influencer retains |
| License type | Non-exclusive |
| Territory | Worldwide |
| Duration | Perpetual |
| Fee | Royalty-free, fully paid |
| Sublicense | Yes |
| Use | Marketing, promotion, commercial purposes |

### Preexisting/Third-Party IP
> "If Deliverables contain prior IP owned by Influencer or third party, Influencer grants Brand non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free license with sublicense rights."

### Red Flags (for Creator)

| Issue | Risk | Preferred Fix |
|-------|------|---------------|
| Full IP assignment (not license) | 🔴 | Retain ownership, grant license |
| Exclusive license | 🔴 | Non-exclusive |
| Additional uses at no fee | 🟡 | Price separately (whitelisting) |
| Perpetual for one-time fee | 🟡 | Time-limited or premium |

---

## 3A. Whitelisting & Paid Usage 💰 PRICING CRITICAL

### Definitions

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Whitelisting** | Brand runs creator content as ads from creator's handle |
| **Dark Posting** | Brand runs ads from brand handle using creator content |
| **Paid Usage** | Content used in paid advertising (not just organic) |
| **Boosting** | Brand pays to amplify creator's organic post |

> **BK Guidance:** Each usage right should be priced separately. Perpetual paid usage with one-time fee led to litigation (see PopSugar case above).

### Skala Standard
> "Brand's license includes the right to use Deliverables for marketing and promotional purposes."

**⚠️ Check:** Does "promotional purposes" include paid advertising? If unclear, negotiate.

### Negotiation Positions (Creator)

| Issue | Preferred | Fallback |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Whitelisting term | Separate fee per month | Included for X months in base fee |
| Paid usage | Separate fee, time-limited | Included with time limit (90 days) |
| Usage cap | Ad spend cap (negotiate amount) | Time limit only |
| Reporting | Brand provides usage reports | Quarterly summary |
| Extension | Pro-rata pricing | Right of first refusal |

### Pricing Principles

> **BK Guidance:** Whitelisting and paid usage should be priced separately from organic content fees. Specific rates depend on niche, engagement, and negotiation — avoid perpetual rights without additional compensation.

**Key questions to resolve:**
- Is whitelisting (ads from Creator's handle) included or separate?
- What is the time limit for paid advertising use?
- Is there an ad spend cap?
- Will Brand provide usage reports?

### Red Flags

| 🔴 Issue | Fix |
|----------|-----|
| "Perpetual paid usage rights" with one-time fee | Time-limit or significant premium |
| No usage reporting | Add quarterly reports |
| Unlimited ad spend | Add $ cap |
| Whitelisting without handle attribution | Require "Sponsored by [Creator]" |

---

## 4. AI Tools Compliance ⚠️ NEW CRITICAL SECTION

### Skala Standard
> "Influencer will exploit AI Tools in accordance with their licenses and terms, secure any necessary consents for training data, model usage, and output licensing, and will not use AI Tools in a manner that infringes third-party rights."

### Required Elements

| Requirement | Check For |
|-------------|-----------|
| License compliance | AI tools used per their terms |
| Training data consent | Proper rights for training data |
| Output licensing | Rights to use AI-generated output |
| Non-infringement | No third-party rights violations |
| Disclosure on request | Brand can request list of AI tools used |

### Prohibited Uses (Skala)
> "Influencer will not use Synthetic Media to:
> - Impersonate or misappropriate name, image, or voice of any real person without written consent
> - Create deceptive testimonials about product performance
> - Depict results that are materially unattainable in normal use"

### Negotiation Positions

| Issue | Preferred (Creator) | Fallback |
|-------|---------------------|----------|
| AI tool approval | Notify Brand of tools used | Pre-approval required |
| Synthetic Media limits | Per Skala prohibitions | Brand approval per use |
| Liability for AI issues | Mutual | Creator with carve-outs |

---

## 5. Synthetic Media Disclosures ⚠️ NEW CRITICAL SECTION

### Skala Standard
> "For each Deliverable that includes Synthetic Media, Influencer will ensure clear, prominent disclosure that content or persona is virtual or AI-generated, in addition to any required sponsorship disclosures."

### Disclosure Requirements

| Requirement | Standard |
|-------------|----------|
| Placement | Within content or beginning of caption/narration |
| Visibility | "Unavoidable" |
| Language | Primary language of Deliverable |
| Platform tools | Use available AI content labels |
| Combined with | FTC sponsorship disclosures |

### Failure to Disclose
> "Failure to include required disclosures will be promptly cured by removal and re-posting with proper disclosures."

---

## 6. FTC Compliance ⚠️ CRITICAL — 16 CFR Part 255

### Regulatory Framework
- **FTC Act §5** — Prohibits unfair or deceptive acts
- **16 CFR Part 255** — Endorsement Guides
- **FTC Disclosures 101** — Social media guidance

### Skala Standard
> "Influencer must clearly disclose material connection to Brand in each Deliverable (e.g., using '#Ad' or '#Sponsored') and ensure disclosures are prominent and comply with FTC requirements."

### Material Connection = Must Disclose
Any relationship that might affect credibility of endorsement:
- Payment (including free products)
- Employment/consulting relationship
- Family/personal relationship
- Equity/investment stake

### Disclosure Requirements (FTC)

| Element | FTC Standard | Compliance |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| **Placement** | Beginning, not buried | First 3 lines (Instagram), first 3 seconds (video) |
| **Visibility** | Hard to miss | Same font size, contrasting color |
| **Language** | Clear to audience | "#Ad" "#Sponsored" (not #sp #partner #collab alone) |
| **Platform** | Use native tools | Instagram Paid Partnership, TikTok Branded Content |

### Approved Disclosure Language
| ✅ Clear | ❌ Ambiguous |
|----------|-------------|
| #Ad | #sp |
| #Sponsored | #partner |
| #BrandPartner | #collab |
| "Paid partnership with [Brand]" | #ambassador |
| "Ad" at start of caption | Disclosure at end only |

### FTC Enforcement Risks
- **Warning letters** — FTC sends to influencers directly
- **Cease and desist** — Requires corrective action
- **Civil penalties** — Adjusted annually; check current FTC penalty schedule
- **Brand liability** — FTC holds advertisers responsible for influencer violations

### Negotiation Positions

| Preferred (Creator) | Fallback |
|---------------------|----------|
| Joint responsibility; Brand provides compliant copy | Creator discloses; Brand substantiates claims |
| Brand indemnifies for claim substantiation failures | Mutual indemnification |
| Specific disclosure language agreed in SOW | Per FTC guidelines |
| Brand reviews disclosures before posting | Creator follows FTC Disclosures 101 |

### Skala: Platform/Regulator Cooperation
> "Influencer will cooperate with Brand in any inquiry by Social Media Platforms or regulators concerning Deliverables."

---

## 7. Exclusivity 💰 COMPENSATION BENCHMARKS

### Skala Standard
> "Brand owes no consideration for any Exclusive Relationship beyond the Compensation expressly stated in this Agreement."

**Translation:** If exclusivity required, it must be SEPARATELY PRICED in Key Terms.

### Red Flags
- Category exclusivity >12 months
- Vague "competitive products"
- No additional compensation
- Extends beyond campaign period
- "Industry" exclusivity (vs. specific category)

### Exclusivity Pricing Principles

> **BK Guidance (from Gymshark v. Massiah):** Non-compete and exclusivity restrictions require separate compensation. Unpaid exclusivity periods led to litigation. Key principles:
> - Limit exclusivity to 0-6 months
> - Pay separately for any restriction period
> - Name specific competitors (Exhibit A), not broad categories
> - Avoid "industry" exclusivity — use narrow product category

### Negotiation Positions

| Preferred (Creator) | Fallback |
|---------------------|----------|
| No exclusivity | Named competitors only (Exhibit A) |
| If exclusivity: ≤3 months | 6 months with separate compensation |
| Category narrowly defined | "Directly competitive to [specific product]" |
| Written list of competitors | "Brand's primary competitors as of Effective Date" |
| Right to request additions post-signing | 30-day cure for inadvertent violations |
| Separate fee for extension | Pro-rata monthly pricing |

### Category Definition Examples

| ✅ Narrow (Acceptable) | ❌ Broad (Problematic) |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| "Energy drinks" | "Beverages" |
| "Running shoes" | "Athletic apparel" |
| "Skincare serums" | "Beauty products" |
| "Meal kit delivery" | "Food companies" |

### Skala Key Terms Format
> "Exclusive Relationship: [Yes/No]. If Yes: Category: [___]. Duration: [___]. Competitors: [list or Exhibit A]."

## 10A. Morality Clause ⚠️ REPUTATION PROTECTION

### Purpose
Allows Brand to terminate if Creator's conduct damages Brand reputation.

### Skala Standard

### Typical Morality Clause Elements

| Element | Brand Position | Creator Counter |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Trigger** | "Any conduct that brings disrepute" | "Criminal conviction or credible public allegation" |

| Applies only during campaign | Extends 30 days post-campaign |
| Pro-rata payment for completed work | Return advance only, keep earned fees |

| Includes "past conduct" | Retroactive liability |
| No mutual application | Only Creator subject to clause |

## 10B. AI Influencer / Virtual Influencer 🤖 SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

### When Applicable
Agreement involves:
- AI-generated personas (Lil Miquela, etc.)
- Virtual avatars representing real people
- Deepfake-style content (with consent)
- Fully synthetic content creators

### Skala AI Influencer Template Additions

#### Enhanced Definitions
> "**Synthetic Media**" means any audio, video, image, or text content that has been generated, manipulated, or modified using artificial intelligence, machine learning, or similar technologies, including but not limited to deepfakes, AI-generated personas, and digitally altered likenesses."

#### Required Disclosures (AI Influencer)
> "Each Deliverable must include clear, prominent disclosure that the persona is virtual or AI-generated, in addition to any required sponsorship disclosures under FTC guidelines."

### Negotiation Positions

| Issue | Preferred (Creator/Developer) | Fallback |

| Output ownership | Per standard IP section | Work-for-hire with license back |

### Regulatory Landscape

- **Platform Policies** — Meta, TikTok require AI content labels; check current platform guidelines
