# Startup Due Diligence Skill

## Overview

Conduct legal due diligence on early-stage US startups (Seed/Series A). This skill supports:
- **Investors**: Identify risks before investing
- **Founders**: Prepare for diligence, fix issues proactively

## Workflow

### Step 1: Intake

Collect context before proceeding:

```
1. Perspective: Investor or Founder?
2. Stage: Pre-seed / Seed / Series A
3. Scope: Full DD or specific area (Corporate, Cap Table, IP, etc.)
4. Company basics: Name, State, Entity type, Industry
```

### Step 2: Document Collection

Based on scope, request documents by category. See `references/checklists/` for complete lists:

| Category | Reference File |
|----------|----------------|
| Corporate & Formation | `references/checklists/corporate.md` |
| Cap Table & Securities | `references/checklists/cap-table.md` |
| Intellectual Property | `references/checklists/ip.md` |
| Employment & Founders | `references/checklists/employment.md` |
| Material Contracts | `references/checklists/contracts.md` |
| Compliance & Regulatory | `references/checklists/compliance.md` |
| Litigation | `references/checklists/litigation.md` |
| Financial | `references/checklists/financials.md` |

### Step 3: Document Review

For each document received:
1. Identify document type and category
2. Check against category-specific criteria
3. Flag issues using severity ratings (see below)
4. Cross-reference with other documents for consistency

**Severity Ratings:**
- 🔴 **CRITICAL**: Deal blocker, must resolve before closing
- 🟠 **MATERIAL**: Significant risk, requires remediation plan
- 🟡 **MINOR**: Should be fixed, but not blocking

See `references/red-flags/common-issues.md` for comprehensive issue patterns.

### Step 4: Issue Analysis

For identified issues, provide:
1. **Description**: What the issue is
2. **Risk**: Why it matters
3. **Remediation**: How to fix it
4. **Timeline**: Estimated effort to resolve
5. **Escalation**: Whether legal counsel required

### Step 5: Report Generation

Generate deliverables using templates in `assets/templates/`.

**CRITICAL: Template Usage Protocol**

NEVER directly edit template .docx files. Always use the deterministic script:

```bash
# 1. Collect data into JSON
cat > data.json << 'EOF'
{
  "COMPANY_NAME": "Acme Inc.",
  "REPORT_DATE": "2024-01-15",
  ...
}
EOF

# 2. Validate data
python scripts/validate_data.py diligence-report data.json

# 3. Populate template (deterministic - only fills {{PLACEHOLDERS}})
python scripts/populate_template.py assets/templates/diligence-report.docx data.json output.docx
```

This ensures template text is NEVER modified - only placeholders are filled.

## Guidance Documents

Load these as needed based on the issues encountered:

| Topic | Reference |
|-------|-----------|
| SAFE notes & convertibles | `references/guidance/safe-notes.md` |
| Delaware C-Corp specifics | `references/guidance/delaware-corp.md` |
| Stock options & 409A | `references/guidance/409a-options.md` |
| Founder equity & vesting | `references/guidance/founder-equity.md` |

## Quick Reference: Common Red Flags

**Corporate**
- Missing board/stockholder consents for key actions
- Charter not filed or not current
- No bylaws or outdated bylaws

**Cap Table**
- Discrepancies between cap table and stock ledger
- Options granted without 409A valuation
- SAFE/note terms not modeled in pro forma

**IP**
- No IP assignment from founders (pre-incorporation work)
- Missing PIIA from contractors who built product
- Open source license violations

**Employment**
- Founder shares not vesting (or fully vested day 1)
- Key employees without offer letters/agreements
- Misclassified contractors

**Compliance**
- No securities filings (Form D, Blue Sky)
- Missing 83(b) elections for early exercises

## Output Formats

1. **Summary Table**: Quick overview of findings by category
2. **Detailed Report**: Full analysis with recommendations (DOCX)
3. **Issue Tracker**: Spreadsheet format for tracking remediation
4. **Document Request List**: Customized checklist for target company

## Disclaimers

- This is diligence assistance, not legal advice
- All findings should be reviewed by qualified legal counsel
- Escalate securities, tax, and regulatory matters to specialists
- Document review is point-in-time; circumstances may change
