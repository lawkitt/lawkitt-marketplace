# OFAC Eases Venezuelan Oil Sanctions Following Maduro Apprehension

January 30, 2026 | Economic Sanctions | United States

## In Brief

On January 29, 2026, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign
Assets Control ("OFAC") issued General License ("GL") 46 authorizing certain
transactions relating to the lifting, refinement, and trade of Venezuelan-origin
oil by established U.S. entities.

This marks the first public action by OFAC in revising the general Venezuela
sanctions regime since the U.S. apprehension of Nicolás Maduro. While the
issuance of GL 46 is a significant move in easing sanctions, its precise scope
warrants close review as the new license continues to place strict requirements
with respect to operations in the Venezuelan oil sector.

## Key Takeaways

• GL 46 authorizes transactions by "established U.S. entities" for lifting,
  exportation, and trade of Venezuelan-origin oil, including refining
• New restrictions not present in prior GL 44 include: limiting involvement
  to established U.S. entities; adding China to prohibited counterparties;
  imposing mandatory contractual terms
• GL 46 contains no expiration date but remains subject to revocation by
  OFAC at any time
• Payment to blocked entities must be made into Foreign Government Deposit Funds

# Landmark UK Decision Reinstates Privilege Protection to Investigation Work Product

October 2018 | Compliance & Investigations | United Kingdom / Hong Kong

## In Brief

On 5 September 2018, the UK Court of Appeal overturned the 2017 High Court
ruling in SFO v ENRC and held that notes of interviews with company employees
are protected by litigation privilege even if a formal criminal investigation
has not been commenced.

This landmark decision resolves the controversy surrounding the ENRC Decision
which held that certain documents, including working papers and notes made by
lawyers, could not enjoy privilege because they had been created before criminal
legal proceedings were contemplated.

## Key Takeaways

• Interview notes with company employees prepared by lawyers have the benefit
  of litigation privilege, even before formal investigation commences
• Legal advice given to avoid or settle reasonably contemplated proceedings
  is protected by litigation privilege
• The question of legal advice privilege for interview notes was not resolved
  and may require Supreme Court consideration
• Hong Kong provides broader privilege protection through the dominant purpose
  test confirmed in CITIC

## Implications of the Decision
[Detailed analysis covering whistleblowers, likelihood of prosecution,
corporate compliance implications]

## Actions to Consider

1. Engage external lawyers at the outset and carefully consider the terms
   and scope of engagement
2. Seek legal advice and review internal protocols for handling communications
3. Seek legal advice when faced with third party disclosure requests

# Bank of England Revises Its Proposed Regime for Regulating "Systemic" Stablecoins

January 2026 | Financial Services | United Kingdom

## Executive Summary

• **What's new**: The Bank of England issued a consultation paper setting out
  its latest proposals for regulating stablecoins deemed "systemic," including
  requirements for backing assets, capital and reserves, and redemption procedures.

• **Why it matters**: The Bank's proposals are more restrictive than the FCA's
  proposed rules for non-systemic stablecoins. The Bank will consider transaction
  volume, nature of transactions, and interconnectedness with systemically
  important financial market infrastructure.

• **What to do next**: The industry should monitor the ongoing consultation and
  consider submitting comments before February 2026.

## What Is a Systemic Stablecoin?

The Bank's proposals relate only to sterling-denominated systemic stablecoins.
HM Treasury determines whether a payment system or service provider is systemic.
Criteria include:
- Number and value of transactions processed
- Nature of transactions and services
- Relationship with other systems (interconnectedness)
- Whether used by the Bank as monetary authority

## Key Requirements

### Backing Assets
- At least 40% must comprise unremunerated central bank deposits
- Up to 60% may be held in short-term UK government debt securities
- Temporary deviations permitted for large unanticipated redemptions
- Transitional period allows up to 95% in securities at outset

### Capital and Reserve Requirements
[Based on Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures with modifications]

### Holding Limits
- £20,000 for individuals
- £10 million for businesses (with exceptions)

### Legal Claim and Redemption
- Redemption requests must be met by end of business day
- Redemptions should be free of charge where possible

## What's Next?

Responses due by February 10, 2026. Final rules expected second half of 2026.

# Ninth Circuit Issues Significant Decision Holding That Absent Class Members
Must Demonstrate Article III Standing At Summary Judgment

January 12, 2026 | Class Actions / Appellate | United States

Healy v. Milliman, Inc., No. 24-3327 – Decided January 9, 2026

> "[W]e hold that TransUnion requires named and unnamed members of a certified
> class for money damages to demonstrate that there is a genuine dispute of
> material fact over standing at summary judgment."
> — Judge Sidney R. Thomas, writing for the Court

## Background

James Healy brought a class action against Milliman, claiming that Milliman's
medical-history reports sometimes contain inaccuracies violating the Fair Credit
Reporting Act. After class certification, Milliman sought summary judgment
arguing insufficient evidence that all class members suffered Article III injury.

## Issue Presented

Must absent class members present evidence of Article III standing at summary
judgment after a class has been certified?

## Court's Holding

Yes. Named plaintiffs and absent class members alike must produce evidence of
Article III standing to survive summary judgment.

## What It Means

• The decision emphasizes that Article III standing is relevant not only at
  final judgment but also at earlier litigation stages
• The Ninth Circuit expressly rejected the notion that the standing inquiry
  for unnamed class members should wait until final judgment
• The court identified prior circuit decisions that are no longer good law
  after TransUnion
• Evidence of class-member injury may be circumstantial as well as direct

# Elsevier Wins Dismissal with Prejudice of Putative Antitrust Class Action

February 02, 2026 | Antitrust / Class Action Defense | United States

On January 30, 2026, the United States District Court for the Eastern District
of New York granted with prejudice Defendants' motion to dismiss in
Uddin v. Elsevier, B.V., et al., No. 24-cv-06409.

Plaintiffs, a group of academics, filed a putative class action asserting one
claim under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, alleging that academic publishers
conspired to fix article processing charges through adherence to a set of
voluntary principles.

The Court granted dismissal in full, agreeing with Defendants that the
Principles did not constitute a price-fixing agreement and that Plaintiffs
failed to allege facts sufficient to establish an antitrust conspiracy.

The Cravath team included partners Gary A. Bornstein, Andrew C. Finch,
Sharonmoyee Goswami and Jesse M. Weiss.

# Major Updates Recalibrate the UAE Capital Markets Regime

February 2, 2026 | Capital Markets | United Arab Emirates

The reforms reflect a deliberate shift toward a more assertive, comprehensive,
and internationally aligned regulatory regime.

## Key Points

• The new regime reconstitutes the Securities and Commodities Authority as the
  Capital Market Authority (CMA), with expanded supervisory powers
• The reforms include express introduction of a price stabilization safe harbor,
  federal codification of prospectus liability standards, and expansion of the
  regulatory perimeter to include virtual assets
• The CMA is empowered with a modernized enforcement toolkit, including
  administrative settlement mechanisms

## The Driver for Reform

The reconstitution of the SCA as the CMA reflects a deliberate repositioning
of the UAE's capital markets framework. The reforms represent a milestone in
building on incremental reforms dating back to Federal Law No. 4 of 2000.

At a policy level, the reforms modernize the UAE's financial services framework,
reinforce confidence in the market, and align with international standards.

## Stabilization Safe Harbor

The CMA Regulatory Law introduces an express stabilization safe harbor,
resolving historical uncertainty. Price stabilization activities conducted in
accordance with prescribed requirements are excluded from market manipulation
prohibitions.

## Sharper Focus on Prospectus Liability

The CMA Regulatory Law expressly attributes liability to members of the
issuer's board and senior management for prospectus misstatements. This
reinforces the importance of rigorous verification processes.

## Expanded Regulatory Perimeter

The definition of regulated financial products now includes virtual assets.
The CMA's jurisdiction extends beyond onshore UAE activities to encompass
financial products marketed to UAE investors from abroad.

## Next Steps

While transitional period extends to January 1, 2027, the direction is clear.
Capital markets participants should treat this period as an active compliance
phase rather than a passive transition.
